# Phase 2 Clinical Trial Protocol – ACTIVE DRUG (AAA) in Mild to Moderate COVID-19

This repository presents a comprehensive breakdown of a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of **ACTIVE DRUG (AAA)** in adult patients with **mild to moderate COVID-19**.

## 📊 Project Contents

- `Protocol_.pdf` – Full clinical trial protocol document
- `COVID19_Clinical_Trial_Presentation.pptx` – Slide deck summarizing the protocol
- `Covid19 Trial Slides` – Markdown version of slide content with speaker notes

## 🎯 Trial Overview

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Design:** Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multisite  
- **Intervention:** ACTIVE DRUG (AAA) vs Placebo  
- **Population:** ~275 enrolled, 250 randomized  
- **Duration:** 33 days (including screening)

## 🧪 Objectives

### Primary
- Evaluate improvement in clinical recovery at Day 14.

### Secondary
- Reduction in hospitalization or medical visits
- Improvement in symptom-free days by Day 14

### Exploratory
- Viral load, antibody response, time to symptom resolution

## 🧾 Key Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Adults ≥ 18 years old with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19
- Symptom onset ≤ 7 days

### Exclusion
- G6PD deficiency, severe COVID-19, pregnancy, psychosis, prior COVID-19 therapies

## 💊 Dosing & Visits

- **Dose:** 200 mg (2x100 mg) on Days 1, 2, 3, and 10
- Visits include screening, in-home testing, clinic visits, and telemedicine follow-ups

## 🧬 Assessments

- **Efficacy:** eDiary symptoms, qPCR viral loads, antibody titers
- **Safety:** Adverse events, lab markers (CRP, ALT, AST, etc.)

## 📈 Statistical Design

- **Populations:** ITT, PP, Safety
- **Primary Analysis:** 2x2 contingency table + logistic regression
- **Secondary:** t-tests and chi-squared

## ⚖️ Risk-Benefit Summary

- **Benefits:** Early symptom relief, viral suppression, good tolerability
- **Risks:** Minor GI symptoms, screening for G6PD deficiency recommended

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This repository is intended for:
- Clinical research learners
